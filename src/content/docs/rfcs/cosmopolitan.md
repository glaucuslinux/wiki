description: An opinionated Linux® distribution based on musl libc and toybox

- Replaces `musl`
- Poor bootstrappability; requires `cosmocc` which is a zip file containing 2 GB worth of binaries to bootstrap itself
- Provides a platform independent libc (c standard library) that gets statically compiled into your app
- Fast implementations of functions (e.g. `memcpy()` and `strcpy()`) given it is very focused on `x86-64` and optimizations
