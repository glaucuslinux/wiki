title: muon
description: A simple, lightweight and opinionated LinuxÂ® distribution based on musl libc and toybox

- Does not support remote build
- Does not support `cross-file` and cross compilation in general (e.g. `kmod`)
- A circular dependency between muon and itself?
- muon replaces meson, but resulting binaries are not stripped?
