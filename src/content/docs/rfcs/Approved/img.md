- `dd` vs `fallocate` vs `qemu-img` for creating .img file:
  - `dd` does not leave holes (use `bs=4M` for faster copying)
  - `fallocate` is much faster, but leaves holes
- Prefer `partx` to `kpartx`; the latter is complicated and depends on device mapper, while the former simply notifies the kernel about partitions
