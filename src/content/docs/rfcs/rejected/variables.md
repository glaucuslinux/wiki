- We don't need any LD variables as we default to bfd

```sh
# To cross-compile mawk we can pass `--with-build-cc` and others, but it is better to let the build system decide
BUILD_CC
BUILD_CPP
BUILD_CFLAGS
BUILD_CPPFLAGS
BUILD_LDFLAGS

# For Meson
CC_LD
CXX_LD

# For the kernel, not required (they are set correctly by default)
HOSTAR
HOSTCPP
HOSTCXX
HOSTLD

HOSTNM # This means HOSTNAME and not Host's NM so don't use it

# For the kernel, currently not required
HOSTCFLAGS
HOSTCXXFLAGS
HOSTLDFLAGS

# Similar to HOSTCFLAGS and HOSTLDFLAGS, also nothing appears to use them
HOST_CFLAGS
HOST_LDFLAGS

# This might be needed for packages that fail to build with `mold`
# LD=$LDBFD \
LDBFD=x86_64-glaucus-linux-musl-ld.bfd

# Better have a file stub
MAKEINFO=true

# No need to overset variables
MKDIR
MKDIR_P
MV

# Nothing uses it
STRINGS
```
