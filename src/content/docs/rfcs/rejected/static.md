- glaucus removes static libraries
- In the toolchain, the only required static library before musl is libgcc.a
- glaucus's toolchain supports static linking

### LFS
- The LFS editors discourage building and installing static libraries.
- Most static libraries have been made obsolete in a modern Linux system.
- Linking a static library into a program can be detrimental. If an update to the library is needed to remove a security problem, every program that uses the static library will need to be relinked with the new library.
- Since the use of static libraries is not always obvious, the relevant programs (and the procedures needed to do the linking) may not even be known.
