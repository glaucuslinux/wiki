- After Spectre/Meltdown, it's probably a bad idea to use Prelink at all as it makes memory mapping attacks easier.
- PIE interferes with prelink

Apparently there's something new called prelink-cross:

- https://github.com/sjnewbury/prelink-cross/blob/master/README
- https://voidlinux.org/news/2019/02/cross-gobject.html

- cross-prelink can be used to cross compile gobject packages like GNOME, which we won't need since we will be building everything as native from within glaucus
