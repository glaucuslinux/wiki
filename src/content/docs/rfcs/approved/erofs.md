title: EROFS
description: A simple and lightweight LinuxÂ® distribution based on musl libc and toybox
---

## Notes
- EROFS now supports zstd
- EROFS provides a comparable compression ratio while having much higher performance and less extra memory overhead compared to Squashfs
- EROFS supports DEFLATE (Zlib) for better compression (check with zlib-ng??)
- booster does not support live environments, proposal: https://github.com/anatol/booster/issues/232#issuecomment-1737913983
- `mount` handles both `erofs` and `squashfs` files automatically and does not require manual usage of `losetup`
