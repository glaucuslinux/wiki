## Smash Stack Protection (SSP) (Canary)
- libssp is obsoleted for modern systems: https://maskray.me/blog/2022-12-18-control-flow-integrity
- Musl no longer uses libssp (1877bc9d8f), it has internal support, so SSP_SUPPORT was disabled leading some package to not use SSP: https://www.mail-archive.com/openwrt-devel@lists.openwrt.org/msg52869.html
- Alpine Linux uses the `libssp_nonshared.a` library for architectures that do not support the required symbols for stack protection. Specifically, the `__stack_chk_fail` function is needed for stack protection, and some architectures may not have this function available in the libc or may have an incompatible implementation. `libssp_nonshared.a` provides the missing symbols needed for stack protection on such architectures. It is a standalone version of the SSP library that does not require linking against the shared version. The nonshared library is usually included in the package for the GCC compiler, along with the shared version of the library: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/58385
- if `__stack_chk_fail_local` is an unresolved symbol. This is needed on i386 as GCC emits [`local` calls to `__stack_chk_fail_local` on this architecture](https://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2018/09/11/2) but not on 64-bit architectures, hence this issue can only be reproduced on i386. Unfortunately, linking against `libc_nonshared.a` is not portable as there is no guarantee that `__stack_chk_fail_local` is defined by this library. On Alpine, the library providing this symbol is instead called `libssp_nonshared.a` but it may be named differently on other musl-based Linux distributions
- This only happens on i386 as only on i386 (and 32-bit ppc) GCC emits local calls to `__stack_chk_fail_local` and can thus not resolve these symbols via libc.so. This is not the case on amd64. Also, this does not only apply to musl but also to glibc. See the musl ML post referenced in my original issue description (https://www.openwall.com/lists/musl/2018/09/11/2)
- Final: No need to provide libssp as we are not using i386/i?86 or PPC (Sabotage and Void are smarter than alpine when it comes to this)
- No need to use Alpine's gcc patch 0008 for libssp as we no longer require it
- `-fstack-protector-strong`: Also known as stack canary. The earliest version is simply called "-fstack-protector", but the coverage was bad (only "protects" <2% functions), there was also "-fstack-protector-full", adding checks to ALL functions, but the performance overhead is unacceptable. The "-strong" variant is an upgraded version, it uses a heuristic when determining if a function needs stack protectors, provides much better code coverage and a tradeoff between security and performance. It's relatively expensive, but is considered essential to prevent attackers from smashing the stack, and is enabled in most web browser engines.

## Stack Clash Protection (SCP)
- https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1588710
- has no performance overhead, and no regressions

## Control-Flow Integrity (CFI)
- https://maskray.me/blog/2022-12-18-control-flow-integrity
- `-fsanitize=shadow-call-stack`
- `-fsanitize=kcfi` vs `-fsanitize=cfi`
- `-mcet -fcf-protection` (we have `--disable-cet` passed to GCC) (**Control-Flow Enforcement Technology (CET)** feature in future Intel CPUs)
- https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/gcc-patches/2022-December/608723.html

## Source Fortification
- `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2`
- `-Wp,-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3` (3 recently added to GCC 12 with GLIBC?)
- THIS DOES NOT WORK WITH MUSL!!! (https://wiki.musl-libc.org/future-ideas)
- https://github.com/jvoisin/fortify-headers
- requires passing `-I/pass/to/usr/include/fortify`

## Misc
- `-z,defs` and` -Wl,-pie` cause packages to break like `nsss`
- `fortify-headers` causes packages like `skalibs` and others to break
- `checksec --file=/bin/gcc` to check if a binary has hardening stuff enabled or not

## PIE
- `-fpie -Wl,-pie` vs `-fPIE`
- We are using `--enable-default-pie` with gcc which means PIE is automatically enabled so no need to provide anything

## PIC
- `-fpic -shared`
- `--with-pic` by default in binutils
- Specifying `--with-pic` has no meaning when `--disable-static` is being used as:
  - by default shared libraries are built using PIC
  - by default static archives are built using non-PIC
  - specifying `--with-pic` makes static archives build using PIC
  - specifying `--without-pic` makes shared libraries build using non-PIC
  - it does not hurt to use `--with-pic` in all cases

## Format Protection (Format string checks)
- `-Wformat -Wformat-security`
- `-Werror=format-security` (this alone is enough)
- `-Wformat -Wformat-security -Werror=format-security`
- These flags with `-Werror` stop compilation instead of just warning so you can open an issue for upstream to fix it

## BIND_NOW
- RELRO is useless without BIND_NOW
