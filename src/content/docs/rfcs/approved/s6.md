- skarnet is working on a new s6-rc project to improve the service manager:

## Notes
- For `kiss-s6-scripts` look at the folder of `s6-rc`
- Switch from `contents` to `contents.d` for `bundles` because skarnet deprecated it (same thing for `dependencies` and `dependencies.d`)
- Apparently `s6-rc-db` does not do topological sorting on compiled databases when listing dependencies
- `/dev/fd` exists on other unices and is provided under Linux for compatibility. `/proc/*/fd` is specific to Linux.
- `sysctl()` the syscall is officially deprecated, but the binary `sysctl` is what is recommended nowadays and uses `/proc/sys`
- No need to mount on `/dev/shm` as we're symlinking it to `/run/shm` which is also `tmpfs`
- `/tmp` is a symlink to `/run/tmp` which gets created on every boot (the symlink however gets created only once at the start of bootstrapping/installing the system `/tmp`)
- The directories `.ICE-unix` and `.X11-unix` in `/tmp` both belong to Xorg and thus have been removed
- `fsck` depends on `sys` to check for some features (and we should leave it to the initramfs?)
- Consider having a `virtual` or a `dev` to bundle some services (like `core`, `devpts`, `fd` and `shm`)
- We want to be initramfs agnostic, so use mountpoint to check for `proc` and `sys` (no need for `devtmpfs` becuase the kernel has options for automount and we can control that)
- We need `cgroup2` to be used as older versions rely on `tmpfs` on `/sys/fs/cgroup`
