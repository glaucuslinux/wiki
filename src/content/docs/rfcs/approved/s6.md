description: A simple and lightweight LinuxÂ® distribution based on musl libc and toybox
---

- `contents` for `bundles` has been deprecated, use `contents.d` instead
- `dependencies` has been deprecated, use `dependencies.d` instead
- `s6-rc-db` does not do topological sorting on compiled databases when listing dependencies (open a feature request)
- `/dev/fd` exists on other unices and is provided under Linux for compatibility. `/proc/*/fd` is specific to Linux.
- `sysctl()` the syscall is officially deprecated, but the binary `sysctl` is what is recommended nowadays and uses `/proc/sys`
- Do not mount `/dev/shm` as we're symlinking it to `/run/shm` which is also `tmpfs`
- `/tmp` is a symlink to `/run/tmp` which gets created on every boot (the symlink however gets created only once at the start of bootstrapping/installing the system `/tmp`)
- `.ICE-unix` and `.X11-unix` in `/tmp` belong to Xorg and have been removed
- `fsck` depends on `sys` to check for some features (and we should leave it to the initramfs?)
- Consider having a `virtual` or a `dev` to bundle some services (like `core`, `devpts`, `fd` and `shm`)
- We want to be initramfs agnostic, so use mountpoint to check for `proc` and `sys` (no need for `devtmpfs` becuase the kernel has options for automount and we can control that)
- We need `cgroup2` to be used as older versions rely on `tmpfs` on `/sys/fs/cgroup`
- `66`, `anopa` and `slew` are based on s6/s6-rc
- `efivars` gets automatically mounted over at `/sys/efi/firmware/efivars` when using `booster`; requires a separate service for `iso`
- Do not remove `sh -e` from shebang in `rc` scripts or use `execlineb -P` or remove `exec`
- `devpts` does not get mounted automatically at boot or with `mount -a` and requires a separate mount devpts 
- `shm` requires `chmod 1777 /dev/shm` to restore correct permissions
