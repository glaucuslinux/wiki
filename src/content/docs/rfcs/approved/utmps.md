title: utmps
description: A simple and lightweight Linux® distribution based on musl libc and toybox
---

`w` will not work in future versions of shadow due to `login` not recording any utmp entries: https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow/issues/945

- Either link or preload using `LD_PRELOAD=libutmps`
- We can rely on musl's `utmp.h` (after patching) and only remove its `utmpx.h`
- `lh-bootstrap` also has instructions on how to improve linking to utmps and skarnet (try it for toybox)

skarnet: "All in all, I believe the flexibility it offers overweighs the inconvenience of having to run services before providing utmp/wtmp."

utmps is a solution to systems using s6, and won't work for systemd, and it implements utmpx safely using a daemon

* utmp.h has been deprecated in 2001 in favor of utmpx.h

* On Glibc systems the former utmp.h is just an alias (or a symlink) for the latter utmpx.h

* On musl libc, utmps can be used to provide utmpx functionality - but not utmp (This means that applications like procps-ng either don't work properly (w shows nothing under musl with default no-op implementation), or fails to build (utmps provides utmpx.h but no utmp.h)

* utmps also uses a daemon as the only authority to manage the utmp and wtmp data, which is an extra service to consider

* we also need to remove the stub header utmpx.h (and maybe even utmp.h) provided by musl if you plan on using skarnet's utmps


* we also need to patch multiple software to support utmpx.h instead of utmp.h since utmps only provides the latter. Here's a list of packages using utmp h (that might require patching) that I compiled based on my experiments in [glaucus](https://www.glaucuslinux.org/):

  - autoconf
  - gcc (in libsanitizer)
  - musl
  - procps-ng (for w and whattime)
  - shadow
  - toybox (some pending tools)
  - util-linux (for agetty)

From the [musl wiki FAQ](https://wiki.musl-libc.org/faq.html):

> Q: Why is the utmp/wtmp functionality only implemented as stubs?
> * if the feature is implemented, you need to take additional measures to protect your user’s privacy
> * in order to use the utmp/wtmp feature, you need a suid/sgid binary to modify the database, which opens the door for security issues:
> * if you compromise those binaries, you can inject arbitrary data into the db, that other programs might interpret in exploitable ways
> * that’s a HUGE risk to pay for the sake of a basically-useless and possibly-harmful “feature”

The only distribution (other than glaucus) that has a working utmps with s6, musl and other packages is [Adélie Linux](https://code.foxkit.us/adelie/packages/-/tree/master)
