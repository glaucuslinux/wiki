title: BLAKE3
description: A simple and lightweight LinuxÂ® distribution based on musl libc and toybox
---

## Notes
- Fastest cryptographic hash function

- Fastest non-cryptographic hash functions are:
  - meowhash
  - t1ha
  - wyhash
  - xxhash

- `rad` uses `BLAKE3` given that Nim supports it via `nimcrypto`

## Limitations
- The C version of `b3sum` does not support multithreading:

  - https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/issues/229

## Others
- CMake: https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/blob/master/c/CMakeLists.txt
- Make: https://github.com/michaelforney/b3sum/blob/master/Makefile
