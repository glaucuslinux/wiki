- Consider `mksquashfs` block size improvements from fedora
- Examine these options for `mksquashfs` (in order):
```sh
-no-sparse -no-fragments -no-duplicates -quiet -no-progress -noappend -no-recovery
```
- `squashfs-tools` compresses manpages by default before installing them, so check that as well
