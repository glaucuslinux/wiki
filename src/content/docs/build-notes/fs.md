- Do not quote `PRETTY_NAME` in `lsb-release` and `os-release` otherwise `\S` in `/etc/issue` will show them with `agetty`
- Prefer `/usr/bin/nologin` to `/usr/bin/false` for `nologin` users shell
- Prefer `/nonexistent` to `/var/empty` and `/dev/null` for `nologin` users home location, as the latter is not a directory and shouldn't be used as one
- What should the version of `LSB_VERSION` be? `1.4`? `2.0`? `5.0`? (What even is the latest version? isn't it obsolete?)
