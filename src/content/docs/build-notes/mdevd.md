- Start `mdevd` with `-O4`; this will make the daemon rebroadcast kernel uevents to `libudev-zero`
- Readiness `-D` only works when `mdevd` is being called by `s6` and not manually in an `initramfs`
- A summary of what `mdevd-coldplug` and `udevadm trigger` do:
```sh
for i in $(find /sys -name uevent); do ( echo change > $i ) ; done
```
- There is no test suite
- `yash` does not specify `PATH` in `initramfs` which causes `mdevd` to not find its `command`s; this problem seems to not exist when using `dash`
- `mdev.conf` syntax:
```
<device regex> <uid>:<gid> <permissions> [=path] [@|$|*<command>]

- @ Run after creating the device.
- $ Run before removing the device.
- * Run both after creating and before removing the device.
```
- The command is executed via the system() function (which means you're giving a command to the shell), so make sure you have a shell installed at /bin/sh. You should also keep in mind that the kernel executes hotplug helpers with stdin, stdout, and stderr connected to /dev/null.

## mdev.conf
- `mdevd` parses `mdev.conf` when a new device event occurs
- `/dev/audio` and `/dev/dsp` have been replaced with newer drivers and naming conventions
- `/dev/dsp` and `/dev/adsp` have been deprecated as modern systems don't use OSS
- `/dev/fd0` has been deprecated
- `/dev/grsec` has been deprecated since `4.14`
- `/dev/hd{a,b,c}` have been deprecated
- `/dev/psaux` has been deprecated
- `/dev/pty` has been deprecated since `2.6.4` (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pty.7.html)
- `/dev/snd` has replaced `/dev/sound`
- `/dev/sr0` has replaced `/dev/cdrom`
- `/dev/sda` has replaced `/dev/cciss` and `/dev/ida`
