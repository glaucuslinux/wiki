description: A simple and lightweight LinuxÂ® distribution based on musl libc and toybox

- Depends on itself, `help2man` and `texi2dvi`
- Depends on `bison`; does not work with `byacc`
- Touch `doc/flex.1` to prevent `help2man` from breaking `make install-strip`
- glaucus does not use `libfl` (`gcc` configure might complain about a missing lex library)
- Explicitly specify `ac_cv_func_malloc_0_nonnull=yes ac_cv_func_realloc_0_nonnull=yes` otherwise it will be guessed as `no`
