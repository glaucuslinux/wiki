title: zlib-ng
description: An opinionated LinuxÂ® distribution based on musl libc and toybox

- `--without-unaligned` improves safety; has been removed as of `2.2.3`
- `configure` depends on `bash`, but can be patched easily
- `libdeflate` is faster than `zlib-ng` but is not a drop-in replacement for `zlib`
