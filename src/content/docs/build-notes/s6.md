title: s6
description: An opinionated LinuxÂ® distribution based on musl libc and toybox

- `s6-svc -D` and `s6-svc -U` are not intended for use
- The name of the service is now passed as an argument to `./run` and as the third argument to `./finish`
- A circular dependency exists between `s6` and `nsss` (at boot-time)
- Check if further logging (`/var/log/{dmesg,messages,syslog}`) is required
- Fix shutdown not working until logout (only when forced `-f`)
- If `s6` does not run properly on `iso`, check if permissions are wrong `1000:1000`
- Check if `mdevd` supports readiness instead of sleep
- There is no test suite
