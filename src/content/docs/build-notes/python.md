description: A simple and lightweight LinuxÂ® distribution based on musl libc and toybox

- `autoreconf` breaks build
- Depends on `libgcov.a` from `gcc`
- Use bundled `mpdecimal`?
- Add `gdbm` as a build-time dependency: https://docs.python.org/3/using/configure.html
- Test suite for Berkeley DB requires `tcl`
- `--with-pymalloc` provides better performance
- Remove the `pip` symlinks in install if it is not being installed
- Check `--disable-test-modules`
- Alpine and Arch provide "Externally Managed" python
- `--enable-optimizations` runs a suite of tests, and then uses collected profiling data to improve the performance of the installation itself, and some tests might hang in cross which is why a native rebuild is better with optimizations, once the system is complete; these sometimes fail on musl
- Unable to use upstream binaries
- Alpine uses stack size patches to avoid segfaults with `sys.getrecursionlimit()`
- Adelie patches `posixmodule.h` to define `int login_tty(int);` as musl supports it
- `--with-system-ffi` has been deprecated
- No need to provide an `EXTERNALLY-MANAGED` file as we want users to use `pip` to manage python packages
- Should we create symlinks for `idle`, `pip` and `pydoc` to their `3` versions?
