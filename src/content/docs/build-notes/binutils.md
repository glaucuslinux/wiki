title: binutils
description: A simple and lightweight LinuxÂ® distribution based on musl libc and toybox

- Does not allow `autoreconf` and does not have `runstatedir`
- Depends on `zstd`
- Alpine reverts `25882` for ARM and PowerPC
- `--disable-separate-code` bloats every executable and shared library by at least 2 MB
- Do not symlink `toolchain/usr/$TGT` to `gcc-ar`/`gcc-nm`/`gcc-ranlib` as it will loop infinitely and thrash your system
- `bfd` does not build with `yash`; only with `dash` and `bash`
