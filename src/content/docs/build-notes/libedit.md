description: A simple, lightweight and opinionated LinuxÂ® distribution based on musl libc and toybox

- musl defines `__STDC_ISO_10646__` in `stdc-predef.h` which gets included by `gcc` by default (unlike `clang`)
- `readline/history.h` and `readline/tilde.h` can be symlinked to `editline/readline.h`
