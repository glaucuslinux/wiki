- `iwctl` requires `dbus`
- Do we need `--disable-tools`?
- Do not use `--enable-external-ell` as it is not stable yet
- We might need to add `UseDefaultInterface=true` to `main.conf` to prevent iwd from manipulating network interfaces names
- Can be used with `ifupdown-ng`: https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Iwd#Use_iwd_with_ifupdown-ng
- `resolvconf` requires `openresolv` to be installed
- Do we need `ead`?
- Do we need `connman` to handle wired connections?
- Use `network` vs `netdev` group?
- `/var/lib/eiwd/` vs `/var/lib/iwd/`
- `main.conf` should be in `/etc/iwd` and not `/etc/eiwd`
- `iwctl` requires explicit enabling `--enable-client`
- move iwd from `libexec/lib` to `/usr/bin`?
- Patch `src/wiphy.c` to provide basename on void
- `EnableIPv6` is set to `true` by default since version `2.0`
