description: A simple, lightweight and opinionated LinuxÂ® distribution based on musl libc and toybox

- Run `s6-linux-init-maker` in `build`:
```sh
sudo s6-linux-init-maker -c /etc/s6/current -L -f /etc/s6/skel someRandomDir
```
- Do not use `-G "agetty -8 -a root -L tty1 115200"` for early getty because we want `tty1` to depend on `hostname` (to use it with different kernels that might hardcode `hostname`)
- Use higher baudrates `115200` over `38400` for faster data transfer
- Do not use `-n` and `-N` with `s6-linux-init-maker` as we have a clean initramfs
- Do not use `-1` with `s6-linux-init-maker` because it pollutes `/dev/console`
- Do not use `-f /etc/s6/skel` with `s6-linux-init-maker` if `s6-linux-init` has already been configured; on glaucus
- `s6-linux-init-maker` does not create early utmpd scripts anymore and users are expected to handle utmpd with wtmpd (first thing in stage 2)
- We have a new `-V boot_verbosity`  for `s6-linux-init-maker` which adds `-v boot_verbosity` to `s6-linux-init` (Default is **1**, which means that only important warnings will be printed. Increasing this value may yield more, but usually harmless, warning messages.)
- There is no test suite
