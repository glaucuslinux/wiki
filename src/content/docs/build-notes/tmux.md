description: A simple and lightweight LinuxÂ® distribution based on musl libc and toybox

- `tmux` does better multiplexing compared to `mtm` and built-in terminal multiplexers (e.g. `wezterm`)
- Void applies a `reallocarray.patch`
- Depends on `libevent` and `netbsd-curses`
- Check if `--enable-utempter` works with `utmps`
- Check `/usr/share/doc/tmux/examples/tmux.conf`
