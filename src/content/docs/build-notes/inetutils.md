- Disable `r*` due to security concerns and are not supported on `musl`
- `--enable-encryption` and `--enable-authentication` depend on `kerberos`
- `--disable-ipv4` disables IPv4 tests
- Breaks with conflicting types for `logwtmp`
- Do we need to use:
```
sed -e 's@_GL_WARN_ON_USE (gets@//_GL_WARN_ON_USE (gets@' -i lib/stdio.in.h
echo '#define PATH_PROCNET_DEV "/proc/net/dev"' >> ifconfig/system/linux.h
```
