description: A simple and lightweight LinuxÂ® distribution based on musl libc and toybox
---

## What's new?
- glaucus now runs on real hardware!
- This is a stage 3 release (native compilation after cross compilation; previous releases were at stage 2 which meant they were cross-compiled only)!
- [`limine`](https://limine-bootloader.org/) is now the default boot loader and manager!
- [`neatvi`](https://github.com/aligrudi/neatvi) is now the default text editor!
- [`reflex`](https://invisible-island.net/reflex/) is now the default lex implementation!
- `faillog`, `last`, `lastb`, `lastlog` and `w` are now all running securely under `musl` libc thanks to `utmps`!
- `DT_RELR` support was enabled, and has resulted in further size reduction!
- `rad` (glaucus package manager) has been improved with more functionality being fleshed out.
- The bootstrap process has been further optimized resulting in a reduction in the number of packages being used.
- CachyOS kernel and modules are being used for this release!

$ qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -machine q35,accel=kvm \
  -cpu host \
  -boot order=d \
  -m 1G \
  -name glaucus \

  -vga qxl \
  -rtc base=localtime \
  -bios /usr/share/ovmf/x64/OVMF.fd
```
### Run via QEMU (BIOS/MBR)
```sh
$ qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -machine q35,accel=kvm \
  -cpu host \
  -boot order=d \
  -m 1G \
  -name glaucus \
  -cdrom glaucus-s6-x86-64-v3-20241026.iso \
  -display gtk,gl=on \

- Log in as the user `root`
- To access additional ttys use `ALT` + arrow keys `Right`/`Left`
- To silence `login` messages, simply run `touch ~/.hushlogin`

## How to connect to The Internet under QEMU?
```sh
$ ip link set eth0 up
$ sdhcp eth0
```

You can then run `ping` or `wget2`.
