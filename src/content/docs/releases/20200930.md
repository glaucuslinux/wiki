## What's new?
Decided to post this release after a year has passed since the previous release.

During this year a lot has changed, glaucus's build system changed multiple times until it became what it is like today:

- first it was a completely cross compiled system that only built for one architecture
- then it changed to an isolated sandbox build (similar to LFS) that cross compiled a native chroot and built everything inside it
- and finally transitioned back to a completely cross compiled system with a revamped toolchain design that allows building for multiple architectures and with different optimization flags

This release is by no means stable and shouldn't be used for production use, it's only here to show that the project is still alive and kicking.
