## What's new?
This release is a modest attempt to follow a regular release cycle for glaucus.

A summary of changes that took place:
- [`radula`](https://github.com/glaucuslinux/radula) was rewritten in Nim (previous version was in Rust), reasons for this include:
  - code is reasonably more readable (more so than the Rust version)
  - much less LOC even with more features added (compared to the Rust version)
  - code is written in a reasonable amount of time (much less than Rust version, again the rewrite itself took about a month, but the speed at which newer features were added is like 4 - 8 times faster than in Rust, probably because I am not proficient in Rust even after a year of using it...)
  - uses less system resources (1/3 of what the Rust version uses)
  - much smaller executable size (200 to 300 KB) (compared to the Rust version 3 MB)
  - can be built using glaucus's existing toolchain because Nim transpiles to C; thus, making use of the optimized toolchain glaucus uses (unlike Rust which is very hard to bootstrap, and does not work all that great with shared musl...)
  - slightly faster (parsing cerata is around 6 - 20% faster overall) (this is probably because I am not proficient with Rust even after a year of using it, but then again I've only been writing in Nim for a month...)
- glaucus's toolchain now uses [`mold`](https://github.com/rui314/mold) by default, and all executables (with the exception of the Linux kernel) are being linked with it
- glaucus now uses [`yash`](https://osdn.net/projects/yash/) as the default shell for interactive use instead of [`oksh`](https://github.com/ibara/oksh) for the following reasons:
  - more strict POSIX compliance compared to `oksh`
  - much more user friendly compared to `oksh`
  - about 50% the size of `bash` and only slightly bigger (10 - 20%) than `oksh`
  - about 30 - 40% faster than `bash` and has identical performance to `oksh` and `loksh`
  - multiline support, which is not available in [`oksh`](https://github.com/ibara/oksh/issues/63)
- glaucus now uses [`OpenBSD M4`](https://github.com/iglunix/om4) as the default M4 implementation
- glaucus now uses [`BLAKE3`](https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3) as the default hashing algorithm instead of `SHA-512`
- Update [default ASCII art](https://github.com/glaucuslinux/artwork#glaucus-logo-1)
- Updated `cerata`

This release is more stable compared to previous releases but it still is not production ready.
