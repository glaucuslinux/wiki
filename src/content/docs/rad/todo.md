title: TODO
description: A simple and lightweight Linux® distribution based on musl libc and toybox
---

## WIP
- Support installing from files `.tar.zst` and not just passing filenames (check beforehand if valid glaucus package?)
- Check what file belongs to what package (or just list installed files and perhaps verify them?)
- Operation Symbols:
  - Add: +
  - Remove: -
  - Search: ?
  - Upgrade: ^
  - Sync: =
  - List: *

## Nim
- Investigate iterators and yield
- The implicit initialization can be avoided for optimization reasons with the noinit pragma
- doc comments
- try errors
- Custom types help you prevent having incorrect representations
