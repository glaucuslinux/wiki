description: A simple and lightweight LinuxÂ® distribution based on musl libc and toybox

- We don't provide `libidn` and `libidn2`
- Disable `libpcre` and use `libpcre2` instead
- Check if we need `libpsl`
- Does not build with LibreSSL (`css_tokenizer.lex` issue)
- `/etc/wgetrc` should contain `ca_certificate=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`
