title: libarchive
description: A simple and lightweight LinuxÂ® distribution based on musl libc and toybox

## Notes
- `libarchive` depdends on `queue.h`
- `--without-xml2` disables `libxml2` (glaucus uses `expat` instead)
- nettle is disabled by default
- glaucus uses `cpio` from `toybox`
- Check if `expat` is a run time dependency
