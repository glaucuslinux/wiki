title: s6
description: A simple and lightweight LinuxÂ® distribution based on musl libc and toybox
---

- As a human user, the commands `s6-svc -D` and `s6-svc -U` are not needed
- The name of the service is now passed as an argument to ./run and as the third argument to ./finish
- A circular dependency exists between `s6` and `nsss` (at boot-time)

- Check if we need further logging like `/var/log/{dmesg,messages,syslog}`
- Fix shutdown not working until logout (only when forced -f)
- Fix s6 not running properly on ISO:
  - Wrong permissions 1000:1000 (Examine xorriso options to grub-mkrescue)
  - Check if `mdevd` supports readiness instead of sleep
- There is no test suite
